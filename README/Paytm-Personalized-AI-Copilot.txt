## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1) Start Ollama (Required)

Make sure Ollama is installed and pull a model:

ollama pull phi3

(Ollama runs automatically in the background on Windows)

## 📊 Data & Personalization Note

The data folder contains mock JSON data simulating Paytm’s internal systems.

In production:
- JSON loaders would be replaced with secure databases or internal APIs
- Data would be fetched using authenticated user_id
- AI logic would remain unchanged
